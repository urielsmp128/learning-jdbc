# Learning JDBC

This project provides a comprehensive guide to learning JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). It includes examples of connecting to a database, executing queries, and handling results.

## Features

- **Database Connection**: Learn how to establish a connection to a database using JDBC.
- **Executing Queries**: Examples of executing SQL queries and updates.
- **Result Handling**: Techniques for handling query results and managing database resources.
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling practices in JDBC.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- A database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) installed and running
- JDBC driver for your database

### Installation
